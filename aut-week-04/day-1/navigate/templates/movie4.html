    <h1>The Wolf of Wall Street </h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p> In the early 1990s, Jordan Belfort teamed with his partner Donny Azoff and started brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. 
        Their company quickly grows from a staff of 20 to a staff of more than 250 and their status in the trading 
        community and Wall Street grows exponentially. So much that companies file their initial public offerings through them. 
        As their status grows, so do the amount of substances they abuse, and so do their lies. They draw attention like no other, 
        throwing lavish parties for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades. That ultimately leads to Belfort 
        featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine, being called "The Wolf Of Wall St.". With the FBI onto Belfort's trading schemes, 
        he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his fortune grow. Belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their 
        cash in a European bank. But with the FBI watching him like a hawk, 
        how long will Belfort and Azoff be able to maintain their elaborate wealth and luxurious lifestyles?
